\usage{
CKT.kernel(
  observedX1,
  observedX2,
  observedZ,
  newZ,
  h,
  kernel.name = "Epa",
  methodCV = "Kfolds",
  Kfolds = 5,
  nPairs = 10 * length(observedX1),
  typeEstCKT = 4,
  progressBar = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observedX1}{a vector of n observations of the first variable}

\item{observedX2}{a vector of n observations of the second variable}

\item{observedZ}{a vector of n observations of the conditioning variable,
or a matrix with n rows of observations of the conditioning vector}

\item{newZ}{the new data of observations of Z at which
the conditional Kendall's tau should be estimated.}

\item{h}{the bandwidth used for kernel smoothing.
If this is a vector, then cross-validation is used following the method
given by argument \code{methodCV} to choose the best bandwidth
before doing the estimation.}

\item{kernel.name}{name of the kernel used for smoothing.
Possible choices are \code{"Gaussian"} (Gaussian kernel)
and \code{"Epa"} (Epanechnikov kernel).}

\item{methodCV}{method used for the cross-validation.
Possible choices are \code{leave-one-out} and \code{Kfolds}.}

\item{Kfolds}{number of subsamples used,
if \code{methodCV = "Kfolds"}.}

\item{nPairs}{number of pairs used in the cross-validation criteria,
if \code{methodCV = "leave-one-out"}.}

\item{typeEstCKT}{type of estimation of the conditional Kendall's tau.
Default is 4. 1 and 3 produced biased estimator
while 2 does not attain the full range \eqn{[-1,1]}.}

\item{progressBar}{if \code{TRUE}, a progressbar for each h is displayed
to show the progress of the computation.}
}
\value{
a list with two components
\itemize{
   \item \code{estimatedCKT} the vector of size \code{NROW(newZ)}
   containing the values of the estimated conditional Kendall's tau.

   \item \code{finalh} the bandwidth \code{h} that was finally used
   for kernel smoothing (either the one specified by the user
   or the one chosen by cross-validation if multiple bandwidths were given.)
}

\description{
Let \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} be two random variables.
The goal of this function is to estimate the conditional Kendall's tau
(a dependence measure) between \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} given \eqn{Z=z}
for a conditioning variable \eqn{Z}.
Conditional Kendall's tau between \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} given \eqn{Z=z}
is defined as:
\deqn{P( (X_{1,1} - X_{2,1})(X_{1,2} - X_{2,2}) > 0 | Z_1 = Z_2 = z)}
\deqn{- P( (X_{1,1} - X_{2,1})(X_{1,2} - X_{2,2}) < 0 | Z_1 = Z_2 = z),}
where \eqn{(X_{1,1}, X_{1,2}, Z_1)} and \eqn{(X_{2,1}, X_{2,2}, Z_2)}
are two independent and identically distributed copies of \eqn{(X_1, X_2, Z)}.
For this, a kernel-based estimator is used, as described in
(Derumigny,& Fermanian (2019)).
