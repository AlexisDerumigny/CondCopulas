\arguments{
\item{X1}{a vector of n observations of the first variable
(or a 1-column matrix)}

\item{X2}{a vector of n observations of the second variable
(or a 1-column matrix)}

\item{Z}{a vector of n observations of the conditioning variable,
or a matrix with n rows of observations of the conditioning vector}

\item{newZ}{the new data of observations of Z at which
the conditional Kendall's tau should be estimated.}

\item{h}{the bandwidth used for kernel smoothing.
If this is a vector, then cross-validation is used following the method
given by argument \code{methodCV} to choose the best bandwidth
before doing the estimation.}

\item{kernel.name}{name of the kernel used for smoothing.
Possible choices are \code{"Gaussian"} (Gaussian kernel)
and \code{"Epa"} (Epanechnikov kernel).}

\item{methodCV}{method used for the cross-validation.
Possible choices are \code{"leave-one-out"} and \code{"Kfolds"}.}

\item{Kfolds}{number of subsamples used,
if \code{methodCV = "Kfolds"}.}

\item{nPairs}{number of pairs used in the cross-validation criteria,
if \code{methodCV = "leave-one-out"}.}

\item{typeEstCKT}{type of estimation of the conditional Kendall's tau.
Possible choices are \itemize{
  \item \code{1} and \code{3} produced biased estimators.
  \code{2} does not attain the full range \eqn{[-1,1]}.
  Therefore these 3 choices are not recommended for applications on real data.

  \item \code{4} is an improved version of \code{1,2,3} that has less bias
  and attains the full range \eqn{[-1,1]}.

  \item \code{"wdm"} is the default version and produces the same results
  as \code{4} when they are no ties in the data.
}}

\item{progressBar}{control the display of progress bars.
Possible choices are: \itemize{
  \item \code{0} no progress bar is displayed

  \item \code{1} a general progress bar is displayed

  \item \code{2} and larger values:
  a general progress bar is displayed, and additionally,
  a progressbar for each value of \code{h} is displayed
  to show the progress of the computation.
  This only applies when the bandwidth is chosen by cross-validation
  (i.e. when \code{h} is a vector).
}}

\item{observedX1, observedX2, observedZ}{old parameter names for \code{X1},
\code{X2}, \code{Z}. Support for this will be removed at a later version.}
}
\value{
a list with two components
\itemize{
   \item \code{estimatedCKT} the vector of size \code{NROW(newZ)}
   containing the values of the estimated conditional Kendall's tau.

   \item \code{finalh} the bandwidth \code{h} that was finally used
   for kernel smoothing (either the one specified by the user
   or the one chosen by cross-validation if multiple bandwidths were given.)

\description{
Let \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} be two random variables.
The goal of this function is to estimate the conditional Kendall's tau
(a dependence measure) between \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} given \eqn{Z=z}
for a conditioning variable \eqn{Z}.
Conditional Kendall's tau between \eqn{X_1} and \eqn{X_2} given \eqn{Z=z}
is defined as:
\deqn{P( (X_{1,1} - X_{2,1})(X_{1,2} - X_{2,2}) > 0 | Z_1 = Z_2 = z)}
\deqn{- P( (X_{1,1} - X_{2,1})(X_{1,2} - X_{2,2}) < 0 | Z_1 = Z_2 = z),}
where \eqn{(X_{1,1}, X_{1,2}, Z_1)} and \eqn{(X_{2,1}, X_{2,2}, Z_2)}
are two independent and identically distributed copies of \eqn{(X_1, X_2, Z)}.
For this, a kernel-based estimator is used, as described in
(Derumigny, & Fermanian (2019)).
}
\details{
\strong{Choice of the bandwidth \code{h}}.
The choice of the bandwidth must be done carefully.
In the univariate case, the default kernel (Epanechnikov kernel) has a support
on \eqn{[-1,1]}, so for a bandwidth \code{h}, estimation of conditional Kendall's
tau at \eqn{Z=z} will only use points for which \eqn{Z_i \in [z \pm h]}.
As usual in nonparametric estimation, \code{h} should not be too small
(to avoid having a too large variance) and should not be large
(to avoid having a too large bias).

We recommend that for each \eqn{z} for which the conditional Kendall's tau
\eqn{\tau_{X_1, X_2 | Z=z}} is estimated, the set
\eqn{\{i: Z_i \in [z \pm h] \}}
should contain at least 20 points and not more than 30\% of the points of
the whole dataset.
Note that for a consistent estimation, as the sample size \eqn{n} tends
to the infinity, \code{h} should tend to \eqn{0} while the size of the set
\eqn{\{i: Z_i \in [z \pm h]\}} should also tend to the infinity.
Indeed the conditioning points should be closer and closer to the point of interest \eqn{z}
(small \code{h}) and more and more numerous (\code{h} tending to 0 slowly enough).

In the multivariate case, similar recommendations can be made.
Because of the curse of dimensionality, a larger sample will be necessary to
reach the same level of precision as in the univariate case.
